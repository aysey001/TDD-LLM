The Log File Analyzer is a console application designed to process and analyze web server log files. 
It reads log files in common formats (e.g., Apache or Nginx), extracts useful information, and provides a summary report. 
The tool helps system administrators and developers monitor web server performance, identify errors, and track user activity. 
Features include reading log files, extracting data such as IP address, timestamp, request method, URL, status code, and 
response time, and generating a summary report that counts total requests, identifies common request methods, lists the top 10 most requested URLs, 
reports the number of requests per status code, and calculates average response time. The application also detects and counts error responses (e.g., 4xx and 5xx status codes) 
and supports command-line arguments for specifying log file paths and optional filters.
