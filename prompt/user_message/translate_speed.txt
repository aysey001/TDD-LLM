This is a game to test how fast a Player can translate and write down words from English to German.
You load key-value pairs of english/german words-pairs from a text-File.
Then you display one word at random. Start a timer and wait for the input.
Check if the input is correct, if so, keep going until all words are done.
If one fails, display a gameover text.
