This is a flask-based Webapplication to add new cooking recipes and search through them.
Every recipe has a name, a description,  a list of tools, a list of ingredience and a list for any extras.
tools and extras are simple lists, while ingredients also have the amount, which is stored seperately.
It should be possible to search for recipes by name or by an ingredient (without amount).

This is how a recipe should be stored in a json-File:
{
    "recipes": [
        {
            "name": "Recipe Name",
            "description": "Recipe Description",
            "tools": [
                "Tool1",
                "Tool2"
            ],
            "ingredients": [
                {
                    "name": "Ingredient1",
                    "amount": "Amount1"
                },
                {
                    "name": "Ingredient2",
                    "amount": "Amount2"
                }
            ],
            "extras": [
                "Extra1",
                "Extra2"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
