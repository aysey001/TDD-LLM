1. Define the game variables and constants:
	* Operation types: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
	* Number of tries per game: 2
	* Score increase: 10 points
	* Game over message: "Game over! Your score was {score}."
2. Implement the game logic:
	* Generate two random numbers between 0 and 100.
	* Display the numbers and the possible operations (e.g. "What's 42 + 27?").
	* Take in the player's guess and compare it with the actual result.
	* If the player wins, display "Correct!" and increase the score by 10 points.
	* If the player loses, display "Wrong!" and end the game with the current score.
	* If the player has 2 tries left, continue the game with new numbers and possible operations.
	* If the player has 1 try left, end the game with the current score and display "Game over!"
3. Implement the user interface:
	* Use a console-based interface to display the game instructions and prompt for player input.
	* Use a random module to generate random numbers and operations.
	* Use a loop to run the game until the player wins or loses all tries.
4. Test and refine the game:
	* Test the game with different inputs and outputs to ensure it works correctly.
	* Refine the game logic and user interface as needed to improve user experience and gameplay.
5. Deploy and play the game:
	* Deploy the game in a way that allows users to play it from the command line or a web interface.
	* Allow users to save their high scores and compare them with others.
6. Continuously improve and refine the game:
	* Continuously test and refine the game logic and user interface based on user feedback and new ideas.
	* Consider adding new features and game modes, such as multiplayer or time-limited games.
7. Document and share the game:
	* Document the game's design, logic, and user interface to help others understand how it works and how they can improve it.
	* Share the game with others and encourage them to play and provide feedback.
